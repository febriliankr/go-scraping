Scraping golang with colly and golang.

## How to run

```
go run main.go
```

then visit http://localhost:8081

## Problems

- how do I serve multiple static pages with golang? I can only serve static/index.html
- JSON response still is not working

## TODO

-[ ] Add get request to /search?url=PG_BLOG and loop through all the links

-[ ] Serve it as a mobile/kindle friendly webpage
